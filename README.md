# Final Year Project Reports

This repository contains the reports for my final year project [Iris](https://github.com/DeanGaffney/iris). The reports were written in LaTeX with some parts generated by a python script. The report for semester 1 can be found here [Semester 1 Report](KENTS_20067423_Report1_Dean.Gaffney.pdf) and the report for Semester 2 can be found here [Semester 2 Report](KENTS_20067423_Report2_Dean.Gaffney.pdf).

## Prerequisites

- [LaTeX](https://www.latex-project.org/get/)
- [Python 2.7 and packages (simplejson, requests, re)](https://www.python.org/download/releases/2.7/)
- [Make](http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/make.1.html)

## Semester 1 Report

The semester 1 report covers the motivation, planning and designing of Iris.

## Semester 2 report

The semseter 2 report covers the implementation of Iris and the Iris agents that were used to demonstrate the functionality of Iris.

#### Iris agents
* [Android](https://github.com/DeanGaffney/iris-android)
* [Selenium](https://github.com/DeanGaffney/iris-selenium)
* [Node.js](https://github.com/DeanGaffney/iris-node)
* [MySQL](https://github.com/DeanGaffney/iris-mysql)
* [Crypto Currency Rates](https://github.com/DeanGaffney/iris-crypto-rates)

### Generating report

Both reports can be generated by running the Makefile in the root directory.

To generate the semester reports change the MAIN variable (default is fyp_document2)
```
MAIN = fyp_document2
```

in the Makefile to point to the .tex file you want to generate a pdf for and run
```
$ make
```
in the directory of the Makefile (root).
